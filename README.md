# Weather App

A React application that provides current weather details and a four-day forecast for any specified city or location.

## Introduction

The Weather App is a project I built to deepen my understanding of API requests and to improve my web development skills using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. This app allows users to get up-to-date weather information, including temperature, humidity, and weather conditions, as well as a forecast for the next four days.

The weather data is sourced from the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org), a reliable and widely-used weather data provider.

## Features

- **City/Location Search**: Enter any city or location to get the current weather and a four-day forecast.
- **Real-Time Weather Updates**: Displays live weather data including temperature, weather conditions, and more.
- **Forecast Display**: View the weather forecast for the next four days, including predictions for temperature and conditions.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean and intuitive UI designed for ease of use.
